	2. Matt Wall (github.com/CSUMBMWall)
	3. Samba Diallo (github.com/SambaDialloB)

OBJECTIVE 
Our group intends to utilize Python libraries to build a program that takes in an audio/sound files, analyzes its characteristics (e.g., pitch, beat, frequency, etc.), and creates a visually appealing representation of variations in sound. If time permits, we will create a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to allow the user to navigate through a menu of options.

PHASES
I. Research 
	A. Python Libraries
		i. Analyze sound files
		ii. Execute data visualization processes
		iii. GUI
	//TODO: Specify libraries when finalized.

II. Development
	A. Utilize chosen libraries to implement functionality.
	//TODO: Document processes and developmental stages of project.

III. Testing
	A. Experiment with different audio files (i.e., user-defined sound file versus hard-coded sound file)
	B.Experiment with different data visualization options
	C. Test different user inputs
