#Multimedia Programming: Audio Visualization

##TEAM MEMBERS 
	1. Chanel Aquino (github.com/ChanelAquino)
	2. Matt Wall (github.com/CSUMBMWall)
	3. Samba Diallo (github.com/SambaDialloB)

##OBJECTIVE 
Our group intends to utilize Python libraries to build a program that takes in an audio/sound files, analyzes its characteristics (e.g., pitch, beat, frequency, etc.), and creates a visually appealing representation of variations in sound. If time permits, we will create a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to allow the user to navigate through a menu of options.

##PHASES
1.  Research Python Libraries
  1.  Analyze sound files
  2.  Execute data visualization processes
  3.  GUI
  4.  [...]
    *  TODO: Specify libraries when finalized.

2.  Development
  1.  Utilize chosen libraries to implement functionality
  2.  [...]
    *  TODO: Document processes and developmental stages of project.

3.  Testing
  1.  Experiment with different audio files (i.e., user-defined sound file versus hard-coded sound file)
  2.  Experiment with different data visualization options
  3.  Test different user inputs
